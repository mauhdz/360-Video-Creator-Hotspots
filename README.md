# 360-Video-Creator-Hotspots
360 video player in Unity
Currently allows to play and pause video, toggle cameras between a latlong and 360 view, gives mouse interaction to navigate the 360 view 
and allows dropping 3D Objects on 360 view with a right mouse click. 
Just add your video src and it should work. 
For building to WebGL remember you must use a url to the video stored in your htdocs of your localhost.
